# Advanced-BookSpider

This spider builds off the first spider that I created. Using CSS selectors and Xpath statements, this spider goes to the selected URL(which holds a list of 1000 books), then loops through each book, on each page, and returns important info such as book url, price, category, description etc. Results are then stored in csv or json file.
